# Expedition

Expedition is a new gamemode for Rain World featuring randomised starting locations, challenges and permadeath. Embark on a new expedition as Monk, Survivor or Hunter with the goal of completing a list of random challenges. Complete expeditions with certain conditions to unlock new perks for use in future runs or badges for showing off your skills.

## Difficulty

Expedition mode can be played as all three Slugcats, each with their own pros and cons just like in Story mode, e.g. Monk will permanently unlock gates and Hunter will have more difficult creature spawns, however their limited cycles are disabled in this mode.

There are also Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties to choose from with the following differences:

- Easy: No permadeath
- Normal: Dying at the lowest karma level will end the run
- Hard: Dying at all will end the run (not for the faint of heart)

## Challenges

There are four types of challenges in Expedition mode:

- Pearls: Find and transport a unique pearl to Moon.
- Combat: Kill the specified amount of a certain creature.
- Echo: Encounter the specified Echo.
- Achievement: Earn the specified achievement.

## Unlocks

By successfully completing expeditions with certain requirements you can unlock new perks for use in future runs. For example one unlock may require that you complete an expedition on normal difficulty with at least 5 challenges. A perk may be anything from starting with reinforced karma, to a double-jump ability.
